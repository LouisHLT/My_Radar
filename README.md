### Subject : &nbsp;

In this project, you are asked to render a 2D visualization panel showing a simulatation of air traffic (AT).
The air traffic is a complex system with very strict rules to manage a large number of aircrafts.

In this initial version of the `my_radar` simulation, there are two primary entities to consider two types of entities :

### 1. Aircrafts:
- Aircrafts traverse from specified starting points to designated destinations.
- They become visible on the simulation panel upon taking off.
- They vanish from the simulation panel upon landing.
- Aircrafts always travel in a straight trajectory at constant velocities.
- In the event of a collision between aircrafts, the colliding ones are destroyed and subsequently removed from the simulation panel.

### 2. Control Towers:
- Control towers remain stationary and possess designated control areas on the map.
- These towers are visible on the simulation panel from the start.
- Within the boundaries of a control tower's area, aircrafts can collide without being destroyed, allowing them to proceed unhindered.

Remember, the primary aim of the `my_radar` simulation is to visualize the interaction between aircrafts and control towers while adhering to the aforementioned rules.

Good luck.
